### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

__About Me:__
I am Pooja Ravi, a curious graduate (MScAC) student at the University of Toronto and a 2023-24 Vector Scholar in Artificial Intelligence. I am invested in Computer Vision and the impact it can create in the real world. Iâ€™m currently working as a Machine Learning engineer at 16Bit which is an AI start-up company building vision-based solutions using medical imaging data. I am also involved in projects revolving around 3D Vision and Generative AI as part of my coursework in Computational Imaging and ML for healthcare courses at UofT. I am a Deep Learning Researcher with excellent communication skills, both written and oral. I have published 4 research papers for three of which I was the first author.

__Noteworthy projects:__
- Sketch-to-Shoe - A research project that uses pix2pix GAN to turn sketches of shoes into realistic versions of the same
- SimpleGAN - Recreation of the MNIST GAN from scratch
- MedGen - A seq2seq model for automatic chest x-ray report generation
- SteerSecure - A driver safety app that monitors drowsiness and distraction among drivers
- EasyDocs - A student-friendly application that can summarize documents, recognize text and images and convert text/PDF to audio books.
