### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

__About Me:__
I am Pooja Ravi, a 2nd year Computer Science Engineering student at SRM IST (Kattankulathur, Chennai). I am an aspiring Deep Learning Researcher with excellent communication skills, both written and oral. I have published 6 technical blogs in "Medium" via SRM Machine Intelligence Community and Data Science Community. I possess skills ranging from simple Machine Learning tasks to complex Deep Learning problem statements (GANs, seq2seq, Chatbots, CNNs, etc.).

__Noteworthy projects:__
- Sketch-to-Shoe - A research project that uses pix2pix GAN to turn sketches of shoes into realistic versions of the same
- SimpleGAN - Recreation of the MNIST GAN from scratch
- MedGen - A seq2seq model for automatic chest x-ray report generation
- SteerSecure - A driver safety app that monitors drowsiness and distraction among drivers
- EasyDocs - A student-friendly application that can summarize documents, recognize text and images and convert text/PDF to audio books.
