### Hi there 👋

__About Me:__
I am a 2nd year Computer Science Engineering student at SRM IST (Kattankulathur, Chennai) and am an aspiring Deep Learning Researcher with excellent communication skills, both written and oral. I have published 6 technical blogs in "Medium" via SRM Machine Intelligence Community and Data Science Community. I possess skills ranging from simple Machine Learning tasks to complex Deep Learning problem statements (GANs, seq2seq, Chatbots, CNNs, etc.).

__Noteworthy projects:__
- Sketch-to-Shoe - A research project that uses pix2pix GAN to turn sketches of shoes into realistic versions of the same
- SimpleGAN - Recreation of the MNIST GAN from scratch
- MedGen - A seq2seq model for automatic chest x-ray report generation
- SteerSecure - A driver safety app that monitors drowsiness and distraction among drivers
- Full-fledged movie recommender system complete with a deployed website
- EasyDocs - A student-friendly application that enables users to - summarize documents, recognize text and images and convert text/PDF to audio books. It has been integrated with 'EzPz' a chatbot, that can help users navigate and understand the importance of EasyDocs
- 2MCAM - A real-time, data-less social distancing detector and many more! Check out my GitHub page [here](https://github.com/01pooja10)
